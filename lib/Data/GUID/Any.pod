Data::GUID::Any - Generic interface for GUID creation

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Data::GUID::Any 'guid_as_string';
 
     my $guid = guid_as_string();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a generic wrapper around various ways of obtaining 
Globally Unique ID's (GUID's).  It will use any of the following, listed
from most preferred to least preferred:

=over

=item *

L<Data::GUID>

=item *

L<Data::UUID>

=item *

L<Data::UUID::LibUUID>

=item *

L<UUID>

=item *

L<Win32> (using GuidGen())

=item *

L<APR::UUID> (random)

=item *

L<UUID::Random> (random)

=item *

uuid (external program)

=back

If none are available when Data::GUID::Any is installed, it will 
add Data::GUID as a prerequisite.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 guid_as_string()

     my $guid = guid_as_string();

Returns a guid in string format with upper-case hex characters:  

   FA2D5B34-23DB-11DE-B548-0018F34EC37C

Except for modules that only produce random GUID's, these are 'version 1'
GUID's.
