      separate functions for generic GUID (any supported type), v1 and v4
      type GUIDs.
    
    - Data::UUID::MT is now preferred, since it offers good speed and the
      best control.

    - The uuid binary is now preferred to pure-perl UUID::Tiny.

    - UUID::Generator::PurePerl has been dropped as the author has listed
      it as deprecated.
