NAME
    Data::GUID::Any - Generic interface for GUID creation

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS
         use Data::GUID::Any 'guid_as_string';
     
     my $guid = guid_as_string();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a generic wrapper around various ways of obtaining
    Globally Unique ID's (GUID's). It will use any of the following, listed
    from most preferred to least preferred:

    *   Data::GUID

    *   Data::UUID

    *   Data::UUID::LibUUID

    *   UUID

    *   Win32 (using GuidGen())

    *   APR::UUID (random)

    *   UUID::Random (random)

    *   uuid (external program)

    If none are available when Data::GUID::Any is installed, it will add
    Data::GUID as a prerequisite.

USAGE
  guid_as_string()
         my $guid = guid_as_string();

    Returns a guid in string format with upper-case hex characters:

       FA2D5B34-23DB-11DE-B548-0018F34EC37C

    Except for modules that only produce random GUID's, these are 'version
    1' GUID's.
